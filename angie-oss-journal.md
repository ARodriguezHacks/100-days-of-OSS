# 100DaysOfOSS Progress Tracker

## Day 1

- **Project**: freeCodeCamp
- **Description**: Created an issue discovered on the Responsive Web Design track
- **Tasks completed**:
  - Looked up freeCodeCamp's docs to discover how to contribute bugs (first time contribution to their codebase!)
  - Submitted an issue to the freeCodeCamp repo
- **Challenges faced**: Deciding whether the issue was valid enough to submit. In addition, being specific about the concerns the issue raises and effectively communicating that via the issue template.
- **Resources used**:
  - freeCodeCamp's How to Create a New Github Issue (https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/how-to-create-a-new-github-issue/18392)
- **OpenSauced Highlight**: Not applicable because this wasn't a PR but rather a new issue submission.
